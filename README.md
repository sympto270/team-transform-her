TRANSFORM HER
Transform Her is a project that came to be as a project for the Afrihakathon

About
The project is basically about Gender Equality and helping the Female gender grow while having access to online information and lectures from other mentors and motivational speakers who will help them grow and be able to sustain themselves.

Why
We came to decide on a project like thisto help the women in the business sector grow and make their experience in the workplace more similar to those of the men.
The web app Transform Her also helps the women have access to certain mentors who will help them grow in business. 
We target especially the women who have small businesses because we believe their business can grow and also they can empower fellow women while in the peaking process.

Usage
The app is well put out and understanding to anyone out there. 
We also put into consideration the Deaf and the Blind by making the fonts and photos big or the deaf to see and know what the page is standing for. The blind also can know what the web app stands for due to the written codes some areas for example where the photos are we have put a description of the photo that can be read out by the device the person is using.

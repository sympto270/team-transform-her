    <h1>TRANSFORM HER</h1>
    <h2>Problems</h2>
    <p>Women are our every day to day pillars but at the same time they are not treated as it is deserved and this is why the <span>Transform her</span> group was formed</p>
    <p>We sat down did some research and came up with some findings:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Gender inequality is a global issue.</li>
      <li>Despite many solutions carried out to bridge the gap, the problem still persists.</li>
      <li>In most communities,  women are not given equal opportunity as men for growth and development.</li>
      <li>This has worsen with the Covid-19 pandemic, with increasing reports of violence against women.</li>
      <li>Women and girls represent more than half of the worldâ€™s population and also half of its potential. But sadly enough, gender inequality continues to persist and stagnates social progress.</li>
      <li>It is worth noting that, empowerment of women and girls is essential to expand economic growth and promote social development.</li>
      <li>Enabling gender equality ensures a healthy society, and investing in income generating activities for women, can return 7USD  of every dollar spent.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Solutions</h3>
    <p>There solutions we came up with and we hope to see them making a difference:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>To solve these issues on gender inequality, empowering women/girls to attain career success is pivotal.</li>
      <ol>
        <li>This enables them not to remain dependent on their abusers.</li>
      </ol>
      <li>This training will span for 6 months on innovative leadership and entrepreneurship strategies in their local languages.</li>
      <li>Lessons will be delivered through the Transform Her App:</li>
      <ol>
        <li>An interactive app where women/girls can interact with the app as if it were a live lecture.</li>
        <li>For example: They ask questions and receive instant responses, summary of lessons are sent to their cell phones  as text messages.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </ul>
